androidServerCommunication
==========================
This is an example project for android REST API calls.
The JSONParser Class supports GET and POST HTTP-methods and loads a JSONObject in background.

Within test_activity it is shown how to get access to the JSONObject (just transfer the method you want in transfer[1])
